## NPM Grading

This is a small project that uses the npm-registry api to search for NPM packages and display the ratings that have been applied. Other metrics will be added using a flag system to help developers make their own judgements on whether a package should be used or not. 

To get started clone the repository. 

` git clone ...`

Install dependencies.

`npm i`

Run the project.

`npm run start`
